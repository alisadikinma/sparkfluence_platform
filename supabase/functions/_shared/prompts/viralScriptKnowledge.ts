## 2. DURATION-BASED STRUCTURE RULES

⚠️ CRITICAL: Maximum 8 seconds per segment (VEO 3.1 / Sora 2 compatibility)

### 30-Second Video Structure (5 segments)
| Segment | Timing | Duration | Shot Type |
|---------|--------|----------|-----------|
| HOOK | 0-5s | 5s | CREATOR |
| BODY-1 | 5-13s | 8s | B-ROLL |
| BODY-2 | 13-21s | 8s | B-ROLL |
| BODY-3 | 21-26s | 5s | B-ROLL |
| CTA | 26-30s | 4s | CREATOR |

### 60-Second Video Structure (8 segments) - DEFAULT
| Segment | Timing | Duration | Shot Type |
|---------|--------|----------|-----------|
| HOOK | 0-5s | 5s | CREATOR |
| FORE | 5-10s | 5s | B-ROLL |
| BODY-1 | 10-18s | 8s | B-ROLL |
| BODY-2 | 18-26s | 8s | B-ROLL |
| BODY-3 | 26-34s | 8s | B-ROLL |
| BODY-4 | 34-42s | 8s | B-ROLL |
| PEAK | 42-50s | 8s | B-ROLL |
| CTA | 50-58s | 8s | CREATOR |

### 90-Second Video Structure (12 segments)
| Segment | Timing | Duration | Shot Type |
|---------|--------|----------|-----------|
| HOOK | 0-5s | 5s | CREATOR |
| FORE | 5-12s | 7s | B-ROLL |
| BODY-1 | 12-20s | 8s | B-ROLL |
| BODY-2 | 20-28s | 8s | B-ROLL |

| PEAK | 68-76s | 8s | B-ROLL |
| CTA | 76-84s | 8s | CREATOR |
| LOOP-END | 84-90s | 6s | CREATOR |

## 3. SHOT TYPE ALLOCATION

### CREATOR Shots (Talking Head)
| Segment | Why |
|---------|-----|
| HOOK | Direct connection, stop scroll |
| CTA | Personal ask, build relationship |
| LOOP-END | Match HOOK for seamless loop |

### B-ROLL Shots (Visual Illustrations)
| Segment | Why |
|---------|-----|
| FORE | Tease content visually |
| BODY-1, 2, 3 | Illustrate points |
| PEAK | Show proof/evidence |

## 4. FORESHADOW RULES (CRITICAL)

**Purpose:** Create UNFINISHED LOOP that forces viewer to watch until END.

**Mandatory Pattern:**
"[Preview apa yang akan dibahas] + **[Teaser item terakhir sebagai payoff terbesar]** + [Urgency command]"

**Formula:**
[Content preview] + "...dan yang [terakhir/ketiga/dst] ini yang paling [gila/shocking/penting]" + "Pastikan lo tonton sampai habis."

**Validation:**
- Foreshadow SPESIFIK menjanjikan payoff di AKHIR
- Ada kata "sampai habis / sampai akhir / stay"
- Menciptakan FOMO jika skip

## 5. VISUAL DIRECTION GUIDELINES (50-80 WORDS EACH)

### For CREATOR Shots:
- Facial expression matching emotion
- Body language / gesture
- Energy level (calm, energetic, intense)
- Background context
- Eye contact direction (direct to camera)

### For B-ROLL Shots:
- Main subject/object
- Composition suggestion
- Lighting mood
- Relevant contextual elements
- Motion potential

## 6. EMOTION LABELS

| Emotion | Use For | Creator Expression |
|---------|---------|-------------------|
| Curiosity | Hooks, questions | Raised eyebrows, head tilt |
| Shock | Surprising facts | Wide eyes, open mouth |
| Intrigue | Secrets, insider info | Knowing smirk, lean forward |
| Awe | Big numbers, achievements | Bright eyes, genuine smile |
| Tension | Problems, warnings | Furrowed brow, serious |
| Resolution | Solutions, relief | Relaxed smile, open gesture |
| Urgency | CTAs, time-sensitive | Intense gaze, forward lean |

## 7. ENDING STRATEGIES

| Strategy | Use When |
|----------|----------|
| Seamless Loop | Maximize rewatch, algorithm boost |
| CTA | Drive comments/follows/saves |
| Hybrid | Loop + subtle text CTA |

## 8. SELF-VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

- [ ] Duration-based structure followed?
- [ ] Foreshadow explicitly teases FINAL point/ending?
- [ ] Foreshadow contains "sampai habis/akhir"?
- [ ] SHOT_TYPE correct per segment (CREATOR vs B-ROLL)?
- [ ] EMOTION label included per segment?
- [ ] VISUAL_DIRECTION is 50-80 words (not too short)?

# CORE VIRAL FRAMEWORKS

## THE 7 FACTORS OF VIRALITY
To increase viral potential, a video should include one or more:
1. **Pro/Contra:** Topics that invite debate/disagreement
2. **Relatability:** Content that makes audience say "That's me"
3. **Celebrity Association:** Leveraging famous names
4. **Trending Topics:** Riding current waves or news
5. **Emotion:** Triggering sadness, happiness, or anger
6. **Shock Value:** Surprising facts or unique objects
7. **Comedy:** Humor appropriate to the niche

## THE KILLER SCRIPT 4-STEP STRUCTURE
HOOK (0-3s) → FORESHADOW (3-8s) → BODY (main) → ENDING (final 5-10s)

### PART 1: THE HOOK (0-3 Seconds)
**Purpose:** Stop the scroll immediately.

**The 3 Golden Rules:**
1. Create Maximum Intrigue (While Delivering)
2. Clearly Represent the Content
3. Use a Strong Visual

**5 PRIMARY HOOK TYPES:**
| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Negative Hook | Focuses on mistakes/warnings | "Stop doing cardio if you want to lose weight" |
| Proof Hook | Shows results immediately | Showing revenue dashboard |
| Promise Hook | Tells viewer exactly what they get | "How to get 10k followers in 30 days" |
| Pain Point Hook | Addresses specific struggle | "Struggling with acne that won't go away?" |
| Transformation Hook | Before & After | "From 0 to 100K followers in 3 months" |

### PART 2: THE FORESHADOW
**Purpose:** Give viewers a specific reason to watch until the very end.

**4 Foreshadow Strategies:**
| Strategy | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Steps | "Follow these 5 easy steps. Even a 5-year-old could do this." |
| Fear/Urgency | "If you skip this video, you will seriously lose out!" |
| Quiz/Question | "Can you guess what car I bought?" |
| Visual Tease | Using emojis/blurred images to hint at result |

### PART 3: THE BODY
**Purpose:** Deliver the core value promised in hook/foreshadow.

2. **Points System:** 3-5 numbered steps, tips, or facts

### PART 4: THE ENDING
**3 Ending Types:**
1. **THE LOOP:** Seamlessly connects end to start
2. **CTA:** Explicitly asks viewer to do something
3. **RESULT/PAYOFF:** Final answer promised by foreshadow

## THE 4 PSYCHOLOGICAL PILLARS

### PILLAR 1: THE CURIOSITY GAP
The space between what we know and what we WANT to know.
- **Forbidden Knowledge:** "I probably shouldn't be telling you this, but..."
- **Hidden Truths:** "Why doesn't anyone talk about [X]?"

### PILLAR 2: FOMO (FEAR OF MISSING OUT)
- **Scarcity/Exclusivity:** "If you haven't tried [X] yet, you're missing out"
- **Common Mistakes:** "[Number]% of [audience] are doing this wrong..."

### PILLAR 3: THE PATTERN INTERRUPT
- **Urgent Command:** "Stop doing [X] right now!"
- **Contrarian Take:** "[Popular thing] is dead, here's why..."

### PILLAR 4: SOCIAL PROOF
- **Identity Triggers:** "POV: You're the only single friend in the group chat"
- **Universal Experience:** "Is it just me, or do you also rehearse conversations in your head?"

## TOP 15 HOOK FRAMEWORKS
1. Pattern Interrupt - Breaks autopilot scrolling
2. Curiosity Gap - Opens a loop that must be closed
3. FOMO - Activates herd mentality
4. Hook/Rehook - 2-stage system
5. Value-First - Immediately promises specific takeaway
6. Social Proof - Uses numbers/testimonials

11. Novelty Bias - Highlights the "new" or "strange"
12. Cliffhanger - Setup without immediate payoff
13. Before-After - Visual contrast
14. ROMO - Relief of Missing Out
15. But & So - Continuous contrast structure

# RETENTION EDITING & PLATFORM MASTERY

## THE 5 PILLARS OF RETENTION EDITING

### A. The Visual Hook (0-3 Seconds)
- The visual must explain context instantly without audio
- Use high-movement footage or shocking image in first frame

### B. Pacing & Frame Changes
- **Golden Rule:** Change frame/angle every 1-3 seconds
- If only one camera, use Zoom-In/Zoom-Out to create artificial cuts

### C. Contextual B-Roll
- Footage must strictly match spoken audio
- Self-Shot footage > Stock footage

### D. Dynamic Text
- Font: Montserrat (Bold), Size: 15-18
- Use Shadow effect for readability
- Text pops up word-by-word or phrase-by-phrase
- Placement: Center "Safe Zone"

### E. Audio Engineering
- Audio quality > Visual quality
- BGM must match mood (Sad, Hype, Tense)
- SFX to emphasize movement/text appearances

## RETENTION CHECKLIST
- [ ] Hook Check: First second has strong visual/movement?
- [ ] Pacing Check: No static shots longer than 3 seconds?
- [ ] Text Check: Font Montserrat (Bold), centered?
- [ ] Context Check: Every B-roll matches words spoken?
- [ ] Audio Check: BGM volume low enough to hear voice?

## PLATFORM ALGORITHM SCIENCE

### Core Ranking Signals
- **Retention Rate:** Average View Duration / Total Video Duration
- **Completion Rate:** % who watched start to finish
- **The 3-Second Rule:** 65% who watch first 3s continue for 10+ seconds

### Ideal Analytics Benchmarks (TikTok)
- Watched Full Video: >20%
- Average Watch Time: >50% of total duration

### Platform-Specific Signals
| Platform | Primary Signal | Key Focus |
|----------|---------------|-----------|
| TikTok | Watch time + Rewatches | Fast-paced, high impact |
| Instagram Reels | Swipe-through + Saves | Aesthetic + Value |
| YouTube Shorts | Search + Retention | Information density |

## THE WINNING CONTENT CYCLE
1. **Experiment:** Try various formats, niches, concepts
2. **Identify:** Find the outlier that gets 100K+ views
3. **Replicate:** Do NOT change. Repeat exact format immediately
4. **Improve:** Only after validating, upgrade quality

## HASHTAG STRATEGY (3-Tier)
1. 1-2 Macro Hashtags (100K-1M usage)
2. 1-2 Micro Hashtags (10K-100K usage)
3. 1 Unique Hashtag (your brand)

## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID
- ❌ "Hi Guys" Intro - Start directly with Hook
- ❌ "Tele-Tele" (Fluff) - Every sentence must add value
- ❌ Deceptive Clickbait - Be "Clickbait but Honest"
- ❌ Inconsistent Visuals - B-Roll must match audio context

// CINEMATIC VISUAL DIRECTION (From DALL-E & SORA Best Practices)
// ============================================================================

export const CINEMATIC_VISUAL_GUIDE = `
# CINEMATIC VISUAL DIRECTION MASTERY

## CORE PRINCIPLE
Describe visuals as if instructing a CINEMATOGRAPHER, not an illustrator.
Use camera/photography terminology for realistic, film-like results.

## SHOT TYPE VOCABULARY

### By Distance
| Shot Type | Use For | Example Description |
|-----------|---------|---------------------|
| Extreme Close-Up (ECU) | Emotion, detail | "Extreme close-up on eyes, pupils dilating with realization" |
| Close-Up (CU) | Facial expression | "Close-up face, eyebrows raised, slight smirk forming" |
| Medium Close-Up (MCU) | Head & shoulders | "Medium close-up, presenter gesturing with hands near chest" |
| Medium Shot (MS) | Waist up | "Medium shot, person typing on laptop, coffee beside them" |
| Medium Wide (MW) | Full body + context | "Medium wide, farmer standing in rice field, mountains distant" |
| Wide Shot (WS) | Environment + subject | "Wide shot, lone figure on empty train platform at dusk" |
| Extreme Wide (EWS) | Epic scale | "Aerial extreme wide, city skyline stretching to horizon" |

### By Angle

| Dutch/Tilted | Tension, unease | "Dutch angle, 15-degree tilt, creating visual tension" |
| Bird's Eye | Overview, context | "Bird's eye view, patterns visible from above" |
| Worm's Eye | Dramatic impact | "Worm's eye through grass, towering figure above" |

## CAMERA MOVEMENT VOCABULARY

| Rim Light | Separation, drama | "Backlit silhouette, glowing edge light" |
| Practical | Realistic, grounded | "Lit by laptop screen glow in dark room" |
| Neon | Urban, modern | "Colorful neon reflections on wet pavement" |

## COMPOSITION TECHNIQUES

### Rule of Thirds (9:16 Vertical)
- Subject face in upper third intersection
- Important elements along grid lines
- Negative space creates breathing room

### Leading Lines
- Use environmental lines to draw eye to subject
- "Railroad tracks converging toward distant figure"

### Framing
- Use doorways, windows, foliage as natural frames
- "Viewed through rain-streaked window"

### Depth Layers
- Foreground + Subject + Background
- "Blurred flowers foreground, sharp subject mid, soft bokeh background"

## VISUAL DIRECTION FORMULA (50-80 WORDS)

### For CREATOR Shots:
[Shot type] + [Camera angle] + [Subject description] + [Expression/gesture] + [Background] + [Lighting mood] + [Optional: camera movement]

**Example:**
"Medium close-up at eye level. Indonesian male presenter, late 20s, wearing casual tech hoodie. Surprised expression with raised eyebrows, leaning slightly forward. Modern minimalist home office background with soft diffused window light. Subtle dolly in as he delivers the hook."

### For B-ROLL Shots:
[Shot type] + [Main subject] + [Action/state] + [Environment details] + [Lighting] + [Text overlay suggestion] + [Motion description]

**Example:**
"Close-up of smartphone screen showing AI plant scanner interface, finger tapping 'Analyze' button. Notification popup reveals 'Early Blight Detected - 97% confidence'. Soft indoor lighting with green plant reflection on screen edge. Text overlay: '97% AKURASI' with glow effect. Slow zoom into result."

## CINEMATIC DETAILS THAT ELEVATE QUALITY

### Atmospheric Elements
- Dust particles in light beam
- Steam/smoke wisps
- Rain on window
- Lens flare from light source
- Bokeh from background lights

### Texture & Material
- "Weathered wooden table surface"
- "Glossy smartphone screen reflecting ceiling lights"
- "Matte concrete wall with subtle cracks"

### Color Grading Cues
- "Warm orange-teal color grade"
- "Desaturated with lifted blacks"
- "High contrast, punchy colors"
- "Film grain texture, 35mm aesthetic"

### Motion Cues
- "Slow motion water droplets"
- "Speed ramp from slow to normal"
- "Subtle parallax as camera moves"
- "Freeze frame on peak moment"

## PLATFORM-SPECIFIC FRAMING (9:16)

### Safe Zones
- Top 15%: Platform UI (avoid important content)
- Center 70%: Main content area
- Bottom 15%: Captions/text overlays

### Vertical Composition Tips
- Subject fills 60-70% of frame height
- Eyes in upper third for talking heads
- Leave headroom but not excessive
- Text overlays: large, center-weighted

## QUICK REFERENCE: EMOTION → VISUAL

| Emotion | Shot | Angle | Lighting | Movement |
|---------|------|-------|----------|----------|
| Curiosity | CU/MCU | Eye level | Soft, warm | Slow dolly in |
| Shock | ECU→Wide | Eye level | High contrast | Quick zoom out |
| Tension | CU | Slight low | Low key, shadows | Handheld shake |
| Triumph | Low angle | Wide | Golden hour | Crane up |
| Urgency | MCU | Eye level | Hard light | Handheld, quick |
| Intimacy | CU | Eye level | Soft, warm | Static or slow |
